# Simple ToDo App with React Native

## Why

I have started learning React Native and I thought a Todo App would be a good first project.

## Install

The app is not published in any store, however it can be tried within a simulator:

- the android simulator is bundled with Android Studio
- the iOS simulator is bundled with XCode (only on Macs)

Install the dependencies with
`npm i`

## Run

`expo start`

then select:

- i for running the iOS simulator
- a for running the Android simulator
